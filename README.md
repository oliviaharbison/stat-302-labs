# stat-302-labs

This repository contains a selection of the homework assignments I completed for STAT 302. In these assignments, we're provided with graphs/tables and asked to replicate them exactly. I've provided these as examples of some of the types of visualizations I'm comfortable creating and working with. 

In each folder, you'll find HTML and qmd files labeled with my name (ex. `Harbison_Olivia_L14`) and HTML files without my name (ex. `L14_tables1.html). The HTML files without my name are the instructions and the files with my name are the products I submitted for grading.
